		"description": "<p>They are the children of the woodlands and jungle, descending from the wild tree-climbers. Legend says they awoke from their former selves, blessed with creativity and endurance, but cursed with apathy and shame. Sylvan walk upright on two legs, with two arms ending in innately industrious hands. They have little to no body hair, except on their heads. Females have no facial hair, while the males can often grow as much on their face as on their head. Their hair ranges from browns, yellows, reds, blacks, and greys; their skin from a pale pearl to dark brown; and their eyes run the gamut of all colors. While their bodies are relatively similar in form to each other, their faces have a great variance of broad to thin, sharp to round, long and stout. Even their ears can vary from squat and round to lithe and pointed.</p><p>As a race, the Sylvan are innately industrious and resolute. They're assemblies and dominions are well-known for their dominance and perseverance. They also innately struggle to sympathize beyond their own familiarities, and have the capacity to harbor great shame on others and themselves.</p>",

		"description": "<p>The Pelagus are children of the seas, descending from the stealthy and clever hunters of the deep. Legends says they parted from their ancestors, blessed with patience and resolve, but cursed with greed and wrath. They possess large body-heads with deep-set eyes, 8 tentacle arms, and delicate skin. The apparent texture and colors can be changed at will, allowing the Pelagus to alter their appearance drastically. Their eyes are the only consistency: dual pupils surrounding in yellows and oranges.</p><p>The Pelagus are renowned for the industry and trade craft, master of the seas. They lack a central society, instead collecting only to collaborate. Their patience is second-to-none and have resolve that rules their businesses. But their greatest barrier is their lust towards capital--beautiful, rare, and shiny treasures. The only thing they love more than treasure and wealth, is vengeance: once focused on a target of their wrath, nothing will avert their focus.</p>",

Legend says one day thousands of years ago, a dual sunrise brought about new sight, blessing them with resourcefulness and a stalwart community, but cursing them with short-sightedness and a hot temper. Zavon are covered in short brown fur, with clawed hands and feet, sharp facial features, and a notably long, striped tail. They have deep brown eyes and long, harsh whiskers.</p><p>The Zavon race naturally have an unwavering sense of community and family. They are also masters of tradecraft and bartering. Alone, a single Zavon is likely to struggle with many tasks, but together they are resourceful and are a force to be reckoned with. Additionally, they are agile, adept at moving across both open ground and through the savannah trees. Many of their communities are either mass networked homes woven into the trees or large networks of tunnels.</p>",

Alpin hands and feet are clawed, their face broad, and their tail thick, long, and prehensile.</p><p>The Alpin race grew up and out from some of the harshest regions in Erdon. As such they've developed a rigid and stringent code of society. They learned how to master the mountains, making rock and metal ores do their bidding.</p>",

Legend holds that the ether itself willed the Exomer into existence, born of sheer desire, and blessed with natural magicks and loyalty, but cursed with unrelenting curiosity and stubbornness. They are born as amorphous beings, bearing no particular semblance through their younger years beyond a pale blue undulation. But quickly, an Exomer learns their first miraculous power--shape-shifting. They may take the forms of other similar sized creatures, but never truly indistinguishable. Their telling feature is a blue hue and faint blue mist-like aura in whatever form they take.</p><p>The Exomer innately seek out companionship, but oddly preferring the other Erdovan. Rarely are more than two Exomer even seen together, as they are only truly intrigued by those unlike them. They are intelligent diplomats and fierce friends, and face their greatest challenge when opposing loyalties collide. Their natural skills with the ether magicks have encouraged them to be great teachers at the colleges of magic.</p>",
