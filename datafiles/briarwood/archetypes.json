They pursuit the ins and outs and hows and whys of the world they live in. Explorers focus on their environment, whether alone or not--people can wait their turn after the entire universe is understood.</p>",

They live to interact--to bond with others, whether networking acquaintances or having an unbound kinship with friends and family. They thrive with others, and are haunted by the idea of being truly alone.</p>",

Will they be useful once I assert my command? They strive to act upon those around them, perhaps to lead or inspire, but also perhaps to control, manipulate, or exploit. Directors thrive off control and superiority, but whither over inferiority and submission.</p>",
